## Wedding FAQ
#### 1. What should I wear? 
Anything that makes you feel comfortable! The wedding and reception will take place outside. We suggest "dressy casual".
#### 2. How do I get to Providence, UT?
We recommend guests fly into Salt Lake City and rent a car. Providence is a 90 minute drive from the Salt Lake City airport. It is difficult to get around town without a car.
#### 3. Where should I stay? 
**Please do not book a room at the Old Rock Church** unless explicitly asked to do so; space is extremely limited. There are a number of hotel options nearby!
